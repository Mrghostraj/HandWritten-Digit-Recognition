I have successfully completed my first Machine Learning Engineering project: Handwritten Digits Recognition!

This project involved building and training Neural Network(NN) and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to accurately recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

First I tried Neural network, which gives an accuracy of about 97.93% & then tried CNN in order to beat the accuracy of NN, & I am excited to state that I was able to beat the accuracy of 97.93% by 99.01% with CNN.

As you can see from the below figure the prediction of 225 sample & out of which only 2 was incorrect prediction.

I also tried my own hand written digit to check for better clarity & once again I am excited to state that my model was able to predicts it succesfully.

From data preprocessing to model evaluation â€” this experience truly deepened my understanding of deep learning and computer vision.
Excited for what's next on this journey!
