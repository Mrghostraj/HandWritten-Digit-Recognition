# 🖊️ Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This is my **first Machine Learning Engineering project** where I built and trained models to recognize handwritten digits using the famous [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Implemented both **Neural Network (NN)** and **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** models.  
- Goal: Classify digits (0–9) from handwritten images.  
- Dataset: **MNIST** (60,000 training + 10,000 testing images).  

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Neural Network (NN)** → **97.93% accuracy**  
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** → **99.01% accuracy** 🎉  

CNN clearly outperformed NN by learning spatial features better.

---

## 🔎 Results
- On a batch of **225 test samples**, only **2 predictions were incorrect**.  
- Tested with my **own handwritten digit**, and the model predicted it successfully! ✅  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Normalization & reshaping
   - Train-test split
2. **Model Building**
   - NN and CNN architectures
3. **Training & Validation**
   - Accuracy & loss evaluation
4. **Prediction & Testing**
   - On test samples
   - On custom handwritten input

## 📈 Accuracy Comparison
| Model | Accuracy |
|-------|-----------|
| Neural Network (NN) | 97.93% |
| Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | 99.01% |

---

## ✨ Key Learnings
- Hands-on experience with **deep learning** and **computer vision**.
- Understanding of **why CNNs outperform NNs** on image data.
- End-to-end ML workflow: **preprocessing → training → evaluation → inference**.

---

## 📌 Next Steps
- Deploy the model with a simple **web app** (FastAPI/Gradio).  
- Experiment with **data augmentation** for robustness.  
- Try **transfer learning** with advanced CNNs.
